Stack Implementation using Linked List

Overview

This program demonstrates a Stack data structure implementation using a Linked List to store information about students. The Stack is designed to hold Student objects, each containing a student's name and marks. It includes methods for adding, removing, displaying students, and displaying the top 3 students with the highest marks.

Features

1. Stack Implementation: The stack is implemented using a Linked List, allowing dynamic memory allocation for storing student records.
2. Student Class: The Student class holds data for individual students, including their name and marks.
3. Push Method: Adds a student to the top of the stack.
4. Pop Method: Removes the student from the top of the stack.
5. Display Method: Shows all the students currently in the stack.
6. Top 3 Students: Displays the top 3 students based on the highest marks.
7. User Interaction: The program runs in a loop, continually prompting the user for input until they choose to exit.

Usage Instructions

1. Compile the Program: Use a C++ compiler to compile the source code.
2. Run the Program: Execute the compiled program.
3. Menu Options:
    - Add Student: Allows you to push a new student onto the stack.
    - Remove Student: Pops the top student from the stack.
    - Display All Students: Shows the list of students currently in the stack.
    - Top 3 Students: Displays the three students with the highest marks.
    - Exit: Terminates the program.
4. Input Handling: The program will prompt for relevant details, such as the student's name and marks, when required.
